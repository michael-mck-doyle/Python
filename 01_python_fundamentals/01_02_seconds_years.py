Move the code you previously wrote to calculate how many seconds are in a year into this file.
Then execute it as a script to see the output printed to your console.

year = 1
print("years = " +str(year))
days = 365
print("days = " +str(days))
hours = 24
print("hours = " +str(hours))
minutes = 60
print("minutes =" +str(minutes))
seconds = 60
print("seconds =" + str(seconds))
numberOfSeconds = year * days * hours * minutes * seconds
print ("The number of seconds in a year is: " + str(numberOfSeconds))
#print (numberOfSeconds)
