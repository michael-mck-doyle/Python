# Comparison operators work on numbers...
print(1 < 2)  # who guessed it? ;)
print(1 == 1)  # True again!
# and also on other datatypes (if it is implemented internally!)
print("hello" != "hola")  # python is not multilingual...

# Test all the different operators and make sure you understand what they do. Can you compare strings using > and <?

print('a' < 'b')
print('b' > 'a')
print('b' == 'a')
