Frameworks
- Unittest - is already built in to Python
- Pytest - use pip install to install

1. create a virtual environment - can use Pycharm or CLI
- create a new directory using: 'python3 -m venv new_venv_name'
- use 'source path_to_file activate' to activate the virtual directory
- install whatever programs you need in the venv
2. Pycharm setup for new venv
- select Pycharm > Preferences > Project interpreter > settings icon > Add > either New or Existing environment
 > add Interpreter
- select Pycharm > Preferences > Python Integrated Tools > under 'Testing' select the default test runner e.g. unittest, PyTest...
3.

1. import the function that you need e.g. import unittest, import package_name to be tested...
2. create a test case Class in the test file
3. define the test case (which is a method) - the test case is written in the method
4. the test case name (method) must begin with "test_"
5. use "if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()" at end of tests for something...
adding this to the end of your test allows you to run the test file directly using the
 familiar command to execute a Python script:  python test_yourpackagename.py
5. use context manager - 'raise' exceptions using the python "Context Manager" e.g. with selfAssertRaises..... :  .....
6. Methods Wrapping Every Single Test Case - use the set-up and tear down commands before and after each test is run
7. Methods Wrapping The Whole Test Suite - @classmethod def setUpClass(cls): / @classmethod def tearDownClass(cls):
8. use mock-up for data that may not be available to complete running of test
9. use one main start-up / tear-down module at start and end of test suite
