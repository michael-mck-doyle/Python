'''
Demonstrate your knowledge of unittest by first creating a function with input parameters and a return value.

Once you have a function, write at least two tests for the function that use various assertions. The
test should pass.

Also include a test that does not pass.

    return x + y


def subtraction(x, y):
    return x - y


def greater(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return x + y


def is_not(x, y):
    return x + y
